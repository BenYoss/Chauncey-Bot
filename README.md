# Chauncey-Bot

A GitHub Repo that serves as a Discord bot allowing users to have virtual pets in their servers. Users can invite the bot to their server and each server participant has the ability to unlock a pet. Users can customize their pets including name, type of pet, leash/accessories, tricks/commands, number of pets, and the “home” server for their pet.
